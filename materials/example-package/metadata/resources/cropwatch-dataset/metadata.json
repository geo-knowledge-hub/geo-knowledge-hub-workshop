        "description": "<p>CropWatch utilizes various variables as input data, including</p><p>NDVI, LAI, and fAPAR data at a global scale, which are mostly MODIS products provided by NASA. Additionally, NDVI products from Chinese Fengyun-3 MERSI are also utilized.</p><p>Air temperature and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) datasets are sourced from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2), 6-Hourly products. For further information about CFSv2, please refer to the CFS NOAA site.</p><p>The rainfall product utilized in CropWatch is an integration of CFSv2 rainfall data and satellite-derived rainfall data from TRMM and GPM. It covers the land surface from 50 degrees south (50S) to 90 degrees north (90N) at a spatial resolution of 0.25 degrees.</p><p>Biomass is an indicator based on a model that integrates rainfall, air temperature, and PAR. Initially, the air temperature is used to derive a temperature-based constraint factor for biomass accumulation based on the Richardson model. &nbsp;The potential biomass is calculated by multiplying the biomass derived from the Chikugo model and the Richardson temperature factor.</p><p>The Vegetation Health Index (VHI) product at a global scale is mainly provided by NOAA at a 4 km spatial resolution and weekly temporal resolution. The Vegetation Health Indices (VHI) are derived from the radiance observed by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) onboard afternoon polar-orbiting satellites, including the NOAA-7, 9, 11, 14, 16, 18, and 19, as well as VIIRS from the Soumi-NPP satellite.</p><p>High-resolution monitoring of crop mapping, irrigation detection, and cropping intensity assessment is performed using Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, Landsat-8&amp;9, as well as Chinese satellite images from Gaofen-1, Gaofen-6, and ZY-3, among others.</p><p>For further details, please refer to the attached file.</p>"
