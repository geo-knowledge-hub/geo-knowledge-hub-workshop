# GEO Knowledge Hub + EIFFEL Project

The GEO Knowledge Hub (GKH) is a central cloud-based digital library providing access to Earth Observations applications developed by GEO Work Programme Activities. It includes applications that help users working on agriculture, disaster risk reduction, urban planning, and more.

In an exciting partnership with the EIFFELL Project, we are hosting a webinar on March 21, 2024. This webinar is a unique opportunity to learn how to leverage the GEO Knowledge Hub to share EO Applications and knowledge you're producing
